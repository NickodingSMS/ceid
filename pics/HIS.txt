All of everyday matter projects a natural electric field. It also permeates through all things. The geometry of the field produced by the human body is largely dependent on the body's contour ie, gesture. By amplifying this field, we can use it as an extension of the human body.  if you are at all points of  true gesture control. Furthermore the sensing of presence, via Boolean or full bioimpedance signatures, heart beat, etc. An infrastructure built around such a an architecture opens avenues for security measures n other stuff
